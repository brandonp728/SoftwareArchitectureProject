The patch will be in the form of a file communicated over tcp sockets.
The file will contain attributes that need to be updated, and the individual devices
retrieve the attributes they care about. The files must simulate both successful and failed patches.
json formatting will be used.

1 json per patch.

{
    "x": 11,
    "y": 20,
    "algorithm": "x + y"
}

{
    "x": 11,
    "y": 20,
    "algorithm": "x - y"
}

Possible communications:
